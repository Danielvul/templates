# SubQuery Project Template Repository

This is a templates repository that maintains a list of all:

- Example boilerplate and quick start projects
- Internal and external user guides
- Dictionary endpoints
- Known chain IDs

When users go to initialise a new SubQuery Indexing project using the `subql` cli, it reads the `index.ts` file to show available quick start projects.

We welcome your contributions.
